                <h2 class="text-3xl">Who am I?</h2>
                <p>With a two year education specializing in Javscript for both front and backend, I see myself as in a
                    permenant phase of "CI/CD". Eager to learn new things and take up challenges outside of my comfort
                    zone,
                    I try to aim higher than my current abilites in order to gain more knowledge and learn something new
                    every day.
                </p>
                <p>Combining my prior education in health and fitness together with work experience in the hospitality
                    and
                    event
                    management sector, I believe I offer a unique perspective to projects big or small.</p>

                <p>
                    Outside of divs and script files, I go by "Frankie" and spend my time surfing around the globe,
                    weight
                    training, taking
                    pictures and baking the occasional sourdough loaf.
